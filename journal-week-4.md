Most of last week was spent learning about TDD (Test Driven Development). 
* TDD (red/green/refactor) 
    * I really liked being forced to write some code using this method. I found that if I was very disciplined about the methodology, my final code product was different than it would have been had I just "gone for it."
    * There were some times (for example, console I/O) where I felt like the TDD method wasn't particularly well-suited.
* Overriding / extending base classes such as Fixnum 
* The Set class - useful when analyzing the winning triples in Tic-Tac-Toe
    * Specifically, Set.superset? and Set.subset? (and of course Array.to_set)
* Array.transpose - just learned about this today in homework review
* Passing objects - learned that basically Ruby passes objects by reference, this was kind of a big philosophical understanding moment for me. In C++ you have to explicitly pass by reference if that's what you want to do.
* Minitest
* Atom
* watch
* Rubocop - something I found to help break myself of my C++ habits 
* A little more html/css
    * I have done the reading, and a little bit of the codecademy course on html and css, but I am really struggling with motivation in this department. I am really interested in making things work, not making things pretty.
