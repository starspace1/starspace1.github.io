Most of last week was spent learning about TDD (Test Driven Development). I thought that the Roman Numerals converter was a great intro to TDD. I am also glad we got that assignment ahead of time so that I could get started on it. Same with tic-tac-toe, which was the next TDD assignemnt we had. 

Thing I learned since last writing:
* TDD (red/green/refactor) 
    * I really liked being forced to write some code using this method. I found that if I was very disciplined about the methodology, my final code product was different than it would have been had I just "gone for it" ... which is my usual style.
    * There were some times (for example, console I/O) where I felt like the TDD method wasn't particularly well-suited.
* Overriding / extending base classes such as Fixnum
    * It was shocking and kind of cool that this was possible and so easy in ruby. 
* Array.transpose - just learned about this today in homework review
* Passing objects - learned that basically Ruby passes objects by reference, this was kind of a big philosophical understanding moment for me. In C++ you have to explicitly pass by reference if that's what you want to do.
* The Set class - useful when analyzing the winning triples in Tic-Tac-Toe
    * Specifically, Set.superset? and Set.subset? (and of course Array.to_set)
* Minitest - cool! I like this - so simple to use.
    * assert
    * assert_equal
    * refute
    * assert_output
* Atom (learned about, need practice using)
* watch (learned about, need practice using)
* Rubocop - something I found to help break myself of my C++ habits 
* A little more html/css
    * I have done the reading, and a little bit of the codecademy course on html and css, but I am really struggling with motivation in this department. I am really interested in making things work, not making things pretty.
