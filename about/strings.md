String
-----------

* Holds text
* Create a new one like this: str = "hello" or str = 'hello'
* The + operator can be used to concatenate strings, for example if str1 = "hello" and str2 = " there", str1 + str2 would give you "hello there", another string.
* The * operator can be used to make copies of a string. For example, "Str" * 5 returns another string, "StrStrStrStrStr" which is the original string, five times.
* The <, >, <=, and >= operators can be used to compare lengths of strings. For example "StringThing" > "String" returns true because "StringThing" has more characters.
* The == operator can be used to compare strings, and returns a boolean. For example, "str" == "str" returns true, but "st" == "str" returns false.
