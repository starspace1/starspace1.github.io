Numeric
-----------
* Holds floats or integers
* Create a new one like this: x = 4 or x = 4.0, for integer or float, respectively
* Mathematical operators such as +, -, /, and * (add, subtract, divide, and multiply) can be used like on a regular calculator (for example, x + 6 or x / 2.0 or 4 + 1).
* Note that if you combine types (float with integer) when using a mathematical operator, the result will be a float.
* You can compare floats and integers using < , > , <=, >= and ==. For example, testing 4 == 3.5 would return false, but 5 == 5 would return true.
