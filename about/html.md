Basically, html (which stands for hyper text markup language) is a language that allows you to display and format content on web pages. It is comprised of text and markup which is made up of tags. There are different html "elements" comprised of tags that allow you to do things such as:
* display an image
* make text bold
* make a table
* make a form
* link to other pages. 

Elements can be simple such as 

```html
<b> Hey I am bold </b>
```

Or complex such as 

```html
<form action="" method="post">
  <fieldset>
    <legend>Title</legend>
    <input type="radio" name="radio" id="radio"> <label for="radio">Click me</label>
  </fieldset>
</form>
```

The difference between the simple and complex elements above are that the complex one has what are called attributes (like action and method). Also, the form element above has other elements nested inside such as a legend.
