During week 2, we got a start on using ActiveRecord, databases, and html forms. Since last writing, I've learned:

- How to create a table in a database (create_table)
- How to define the columns and data types of a table in a database (and set default column values)
- How to add, update, and remove records in database
- What happens under the hood with MySQL
- How to refactor json and csv code to use ActiveRecord and MySQL
- How to hook up a class to a database (inherit from ActiveRecord::Base and use "establish_connection")
- How to write class methods for classes that are hooked up to a database
- ActiveRecord methods:
  - .all
  - .where
  - .create
  - .size
  - .update
  - .first
  - .find_by
  - .save
  - .update_all
  - .destroy
  - .toggle
  - .toggle!
  - .delete_all
  - .any?
- HTML forms
  - action
  - text
  - radio buttons
  - checkboxes
  - name
  - fieldset
  - how to submit
  - how to take what the form is submitting and create a new db record from it
- HTTP verbs (GET and POST)
  - Still need to 100% clarify when to use each
- New ruby:
  - .strip
  - that attr_accessor exists
- Regular expressions!
  - they are strange and cool
  - matches return STRINGS NOT INTEGERS
- More about routing
  - Redirects
  - CHROME CACHES REDIRECTS
  - Use WEBrick::HTTPServlet to use regular expression in URLs
