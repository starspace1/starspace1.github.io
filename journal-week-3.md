Last week, we learned about Rails for the first time. We learned how to create a rails application from scratch, how to use the routes file, and about MVC (Model-View-Controller) concepts, including how to create them in rails.

First, we refactored the "Todo List" app that we created the week before. 

Next, we refactored the "Iron Roster" app that we created earlier in the class. I actually think that this was easier than the todo app, but I'm not sure if it was because it was the second time around, or because it was actually easier. Maybe it was because there was no styling in iron_roster. The todo's threw me off at first because I didn't know what to do with the css / javascript files, and because there was only one view for everything.

Finally, this weekend we created a totally new app (the blog) that wasn't a refactoring of something we'd done before. Everything up until the comments was very straightforward and easy to do. The new part was adding comments, because those had a new connection in the relational database sense.
