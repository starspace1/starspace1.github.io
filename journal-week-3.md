Last week, we learned about Rails for the first time. We learned how to create a rails application from scratch, how to use the routes file, and about MVC (Model-View-Controller) concepts, including how to create them in rails.

First, we refactored the "Todo List" app that we created the week before. 

Next, we refactored the "Iron Roster" app that we created earlier in the class. 

Finally, this weekend we created a totally new app (the blog) that wasn't a refactoring of something we'd done before.
