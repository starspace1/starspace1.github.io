Last week, we learned about Rails for the first time. We learned how to create a rails application from scratch, how to use the routes file, and about MVC (Model-View-Controller) concepts, including how to create them in rails. We learned the shortcuts for rails commands (for example, ```rails generate model``` can just be ```rails g model```).

First, we refactored the "Todo List" app that we created the week before. It was strange kind of "shoe-horn"-ing the non-rails code into the rails app, but I made some of it work, aside from the styling. I didn't know what to do with that, and the MVC concepts seemed hard to apply to this because we only had one controller and one view. I'm not sure why that confused me, in hindsight, because we also only had one model :/

Next, we refactored the "Iron Roster" app that we created earlier in the class. I actually think that this was easier than the todo app, but I'm not sure if it was because it was the second time around, or because it was actually easier. Maybe it was because there was no styling in iron_roster. The todo's threw me off at first because I didn't know what to do with the css / javascript files, and because there was only one view for everything.

Finally, this weekend we created a totally new app (the blog) that wasn't a refactoring of something we'd done before. Everything up until the comments was very straightforward and easy to do. The new part was adding comments, because those had a new connection in the relational database sense. It's easy for me to understand the belongs_to/has_many relation but the idea of "migration" is still kind of vague to me. I think it's like a database field update or something. Maybe just the term is throwing me off.
