<p>Unsurprisingly, html tables are used to display tables of data, like in Excel. There are rows and columns, and the table can have headers and/or footers. </p>
<p>Apparently tables used to be used in part for formatting webpages, for example spacing, width, or color, but we don't use that anymore because of the advent of CSS.</p>
<p>Now all we really use tables for are grids of data with headers. Here is a simple example:</p>
<table>
  <tr>
    <th>First name</th>
    <th>Last name</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Daenerys</td>
    <td>Targaryen</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Tyrion</td>
    <td>Lannister</td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p>The above table has headers and 2 rows of data. I'm not actually sure what you would use a footer for, but it would be like putting a header at the bottom of the table instead of the top. You can have both, but why? I'm sure someone, somewhere has a reason.</p>
<p>The following code is what generated the table above:</p>
&lt;table&gt;<br />
  &lt;tr&gt;<br />
    &lt;th&gt;First name&lt;/th&gt;<br />
    &lt;th&gt;Last name&lt;/th&gt;<br />
  &lt;/tr&gt;<br />
  &lt;tr&gt;<br />
    &lt;td&gt;Daenerys&lt;/td&gt;<br />
    &lt;td&gt;Targaryen&lt;/td&gt;<br />
  &lt;/tr&gt;<br />
  &lt;tr&gt;<br />
    &lt;td&gt;Tyrion&lt;/td&gt;<br />
    &lt;td&gt;Lannister&lt;/td&gt;<br />
  &lt;/tr&gt;<br />
&lt;/table&gt;

<p>The table above has some tags such as th (header data, bold and centered), and td (normal data, left indented and not bold). You can have a table with no header and just data, if desired. </p>
