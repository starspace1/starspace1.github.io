<p>Unsurprisingly, html tables are used to display tables of data, like in Excel. There are rows and columns, and the table can have headers and/or footers. </p>
<p>Apparently tables used to be used in part for formatting webpages, for example spacing, width, or color, but we don't use that anymore because of the advent of CSS.</p>
<p>Now all we really use tables for are grids of data with headers. Here is a simple example:</p>
<table>
  <tr>
    <th>First name</th>
    <th>Last name</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Daenerys</td>
    <td>Targaryen</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Tyrion</td>
    <td>Lannister</td>
  </tr>
</table>
