* Ruby topics I've scraped the surface on
  * Time.now
  * symbols
  * begin/rescue/in
  * send
  * regular expressions
  * ERB
  * WEBrick
  * constants
  * including ruby classes in other places
* Ruby topics I'm struggling with
  * Typing | | and { } are annoying to me because the keys are so far away for my stubby pinky finger
  * Easy ruby things that are suspicious because they aren't like C++
  * Basically getting out of the C++ mindset of iteration and declaration
  * Where does data *exist*? Who can access it? What is existence? Help.
  * How do I step through / debug?
* GitHub and its shiny buttons
  * Just no.
  * I learned how to use the github desktop client, kind of.
  * I keep screwing up if I am on the wrong branch and make edits and then have to make it so they are committed in another branch. When you switch branches, files disappear, and I end up copy/paste/deleting in some janky way that can't possibly be right.
  * I still don't really get why we use branches. Maybe the changes we are making or too simple for them to seem useful right now.
  * Ok, today I forced myself to use the command line instead of the github desktop client. So that was good.
  * I just need more practice.
* Personal retrospective
  * I can finally kind of use a mac? I still have issues with folder navigation...or just navigation in general
  * My writing is, sadly, very sub-par because I have more motivation for the coding bits so I leave the writing for the end
  * I need to get out of C++ land and stop overcomplicating things
  * I need to do a better job planning out a strategy before I start coding. I will often write something that works but is ugly and inefficient, and then later go back and optimize and prettify it. I would save time if I came up with a strategy at the beginning.
  * I really, really need to remember to bring my headphones!
