  * symbols

* Ruby topics I'm struggling with
  * Typing | | and { } are annoying to me because the keys are so far away for my stubby pinky finger
  * Easy ruby things that are suspicious because they aren't like C++
  * Basically getting out of the C++ mindset of iteration and declaration
  * Where does data *exist*? Who can access it? What is existence? Help.
  * How do I step through / debug?
* GitHub and its shiny buttons
  * Just no.
  * I learned how to use the github desktop client, kind of.
  * I keep screwing up if I am on the wrong branch and make edits and then have to make it so they are committed in another branch. When you switch branches, files disappear, and I end up copy/paste/deleting in some janky way that can't possibly be right.
  * I still don't really get why we use branches. Maybe the changes we are making or too simple for them to seem useful right now.
  * Ok, today I forced myself to use the command line instead of the github desktop client. So that was good.
* Personal retrospective
  * I can finally kind of use a mac? I still have issues with folder navigation...or just navigation in general
* Things about the class that have surprised you
  *
