Last week was all about APIs! This was really fun because it becomes clear how much you can do with so little code when you can tap in to other websites' data and features. We haven't done anything overly complex yet, but that is clear even from just scratching the surface. 

## APIs Worked With
* Meetup
* Reddit
* Slack
* whoismyrepresentative.com
* Cat Facts
