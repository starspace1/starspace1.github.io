Last week was all about APIs! This was really fun because it becomes clear how much you can do with so little code when you can tap in to other websites' data and features. We haven't done anything overly complex yet, but that is clear even from just scratching the surface. The frustrating thing about working with APIs is the common lack of documentation or examples, and the layers of trash data that the useful data is buried in. There is a LOT of trial and error for me right now when it comes to API interactions. I really want to make an app to export facebook events to google calendar, but to register your app with facebook it requires a bunch of crap that I don't have yet (screenshots of app, your own privacy policy, app icon, etc etc). Google calendar, on the other hand, sounds like it has a much more usable API.
