### Overview
Last week was parking lot week, so we didn't learn any new material. It was a  good chance to go back and look at weekend homework assignments and finish them, polish them, and/or add new features (start to work on beast mode or nightmare mode). Monday we spent time going over tic tac toe, which was the assignment for last weekend.

### Ruby
I learned about the .inject method in ruby. Though initially cryptic and strangely named, it is great. I also learned about the Comparable module. 

I also learned some new ActiveModel concepts, specifically .valid?, and .errors (and error messages). 

### Rails
belongs_to_and_has_many

I learned some new rails helper methods.

I feel like I have a better handle on database migrations in rails now. I get that each migration only runs ONCE, ever (unless you do a rollback). I also learned that you have to generate a new migration to change *anything* ... for example, you can't go back and add a default value. You have to make a new db migration to do that.

### Other
I also did a lot of brainstorming for project ideas.
